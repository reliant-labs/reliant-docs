# Getting Started with Reliant

Welcome to Reliant! This guide will help you get up and running with your AI-powered coding assistant.

## First Launch

### Launching Reliant

1. **Find Reliant** in your Applications folder
2. **Double-click to launch** the application
3. **Wait for initialization** - Reliant will start its local backend services
4. **Grant permissions** if prompted by your operating system

### What Happens During Launch

When you first launch Reliant, the application:

1. **Starts the local backend** - A Go-based server that handles AI processing
2. **Initializes the web interface** - The React-based frontend loads
3. **Establishes connection** - Frontend connects to the local backend
4. **Loads AI models** - Prepares the AI assistant for use

**Note**: The first launch may take longer as Reliant sets up its environment and loads necessary components.

## Initial Setup

### First-Time Configuration

On your first launch, Reliant may ask for:

- **File system permissions** - To access your projects and code
- **Network permissions** - For local communication between components
- **System integration** - To work with your development tools

### Backend Connection

Reliant automatically:
- Finds available ports for backend services
- Configures the web interface to connect to the correct backend
- Establishes WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- Handles any port conflicts automatically

### What Reliant Learns

When you open a project, Reliant:
- **Scans your codebase** for structure and patterns
- **Understands dependencies** and imports
- **Recognizes frameworks** and libraries
- **Builds context** for better AI responses

## Basic Workflow

### Typical Development Session

1. **Open Reliant** and your project
2. **Ask questions** about your code as you work
3. **Get AI assistance** for debugging and improvements
4. **Save and test** your changes
5. **Continue the conversation** for ongoing development

### Best Practices
