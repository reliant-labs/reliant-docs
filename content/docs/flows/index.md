Flows in Reliant enable you to create multi-agent workflows that combine different AI agents to accomplish complex tasks through coordinated steps.

## What are Flows?

Flows are multi-agent workflows that:
- Chain multiple agents together in sequence
- Pass context between different agents
- Handle complex tasks requiring varied expertise
- Automate multi-step processes

## Using Flows

### Running a Flow

1. Navigate to the **Flows** tab in the left navigation
2. Browse available flows
3. Click **"Use Flow"** to start
4. The flow executes with each agent handling its part

### Flow Execution

When a flow runs:
- Each agent executes in sequence
- Context passes between agents
- Results build on previous steps
- Final output combines all agent work

## Creating Flows

### Flow Builder

Create new flows:

1. Go to the **Flows** tab
2. Click **"Create Flow"** button
3. Configure your flow

### Flow Configuration

**Basic Settings**
- **Name**: Descriptive flow name
- **Description**: What the flow accomplishes
- **Category**: Optional organization

**Agent Chain**
- Add agents to the flow
- Define the execution order
- Configure how context passes between agents
- Set up the final output

### Example Flows

**Code Review Flow**
1. **Analysis Agent**: Examines code structure
2. **Security Agent**: Checks for vulnerabilities
3. **Performance Agent**: Identifies optimizations
4. **Summary Agent**: Compiles all findings

**Documentation Flow**
1. **Code Reader Agent**: Understands the code
2. **Documentation Agent**: Writes initial docs
3. **Example Agent**: Adds usage examples
4. **Review Agent**: Ensures quality

**Test Creation Flow**
1. **Code Analysis Agent**: Understands functionality
2. **Test Design Agent**: Plans test cases
3. **Test Writing Agent**: Implements tests
4. **Coverage Agent**: Verifies completeness

## Managing Flows

### Editing Flows

1. Find the flow in your list
2. Click the **edit** icon
3. Modify agents or sequence
4. Save changes

### Deleting Flows

1. Select the flow
2. Click the **delete** icon
3. Confirm deletion

### Flow Organization

- Flows listed with descriptions
- Search to find specific flows
- Custom flows alongside defaults

## Best Practices

### Flow Design

1. **Clear Purpose**: Each flow should solve a specific problem
2. **Agent Selection**: Choose agents with complementary skills
3. **Logical Sequence**: Order agents for best results
4. **Context Passing**: Ensure information flows properly

### Effective Flows

**Do:**
- Keep flows focused on one task
- Use specialized agents for each step
- Test the flow end-to-end
- Document what the flow does

**Don't:**
- Make flows too complex
- Duplicate agent capabilities
- Create circular dependencies
- Forget error handling

### Testing Flows

1. Test with simple inputs first
2. Verify each agent's output
3. Check the final result
4. Refine based on results

## Common Flow Patterns

### Sequential Processing
Agents work one after another:
- Agent A → Agent B → Agent C
- Each builds on previous work
- Good for step-by-step tasks

### Parallel Analysis
Multiple agents analyze simultaneously:
- Different aspects examined
- Results combined at the end
- Faster for independent tasks

### Iterative Refinement
Agents refine each other's work:
- Initial draft → Review → Revision
- Quality improvement cycles
- Good for content creation

## Tips

### When to Use Flows

- **Complex Tasks**: Multiple expertise areas needed
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-stage review processes
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Different perspectives required
- **Automation**: Repetitive multi-step tasks

### Flow Examples by Use Case

**Development**
- Code review pipeline
- Refactoring workflow
- Migration assistant
- Debugging process

**Documentation**
- API documentation generation
- README creation
- Tutorial writing
- Changelog compilation

**Testing**
- Test suite creation
- Coverage analysis
- Performance testing
- Security audit

**Project Management**
- Sprint planning
- Risk assessment
- Task estimation
- Progress reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Flow Not Working

**Check Agent Configuration**
- Verify each agent works individually
- Ensure agents are compatible
- Review system prompts

**Context Issues**
- Verify information passes correctly
- Check for data loss between agents
- Ensure format compatibility

**Sequence Problems**
- Review agent order
- Check dependencies
- Test shorter sequences

### Common Issues

**Incomplete Results**
- Agent may be cutting off early
- Increase max tokens
- Simplify intermediate steps

**Conflicting Outputs**
- Agents may have conflicting instructions
- Align agent goals
- Clarify handoff points

**Performance Issues**
- Too many agents in sequence
- Simplify the flow
- Combine similar agents

## Managing Flows

Flows are managed through the Flows tab:
- **Create**: Click "Create Flow" button
- **Edit**: Click the edit icon on any flow
- **Delete**: Click the delete icon
- **Run**: Click "Use Flow" to start
