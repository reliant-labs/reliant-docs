## 🚀 Next Steps (Not Completed)

The following tasks from the original plan were not completed:

1. **Navigation and cross-linking** - Partial (cross-links added to pages, but hugo.toml menu not updated)
2. **Examples library** - Not created (examples integrated into individual pages instead)
3. **Homepage updates** - Not completed

These can be tackled next if desired, or the current state may be sufficient given the integration of examples throughout the documentation.
